# MillionaireGame
This is my first Ever Python project I did back in 03/2019! This is a simple text based game of who wants to be a Millionaire, including a few lifelines and 10 interesting questions surrounding Geography. I had a friend of mine add his own little touch ups to the code towards the end, but overall this is my first true project and hopefully a fun enough game!
